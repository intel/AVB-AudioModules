 *
 * If the destination buffer expects more PCM frames than provided by the source buffer,
 * the remaining PCM frames are filled with sine waves (with non-contiguous phase).
 * This has to be changed later (i.e. the sine waves have to be replaced by zeros).
 *
 * @param[in]  destinAreas        Vector of audio areas that describe the buffer layout of the destination buffer.
 * @param[in]  destinFormat       Data format of the destination buffer.
 * @param[in]  destinOffset       Sample offset for the destination buffer.
 * @param[in]  destinNumChannels  Number of channels to be written to the destination buffer.
 * @param[in]  destinChanIdx      Starting channel index of destination area, where to put data
 * @param[in]  destinNumFrames    Number of frames to be written to the destination buffer.
 * @param[in]  sourceAreas        Vector of audio areas that describe the buffer layout of the source buffer.
 * @param[in]  sourceFormat       Data format of the source buffer.
 * @param[in]  sourceOffset       Sample offset for the source buffer.
 * @param[in]  sourceNumChannels  Number of channels to be read from the source buffer.
 * @param[in]  sourceChanIdx      Starting channel index of source area, where to get data from
 * @param[in]  sourceNumFrames    Number of frames to be read from the source buffer.
