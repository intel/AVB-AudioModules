 * @brief   FIR filter to be used within the sample rate converter
 *          based on Farrow's structure.
 * @date    2015
 *
 * The FIR filter can be used in two different multi-channel modes:
 *
 * @li One single input channel is filtered by N different impulse
 *     responses. This results in N different output signals.
 *     This is supported by the functions
 *     IasSrcFarrowFirFilter::singleInputInsertSample() and
 *     IasSrcFarrowFirFilter::singleInputProcessSample().
 *
 * @li M individual input channels are filtered by one impulse
 *     responses, which is jointly used for all channels. This
 *     results in M different output signals.
 *     This is supported by the functions
 *     IasSrcFarrowFirFilter::multiInputInsertSample() and
 *     IasSrcFarrowFirFilter::multiInputProcessSample().
 *
 * Depending on the selected mode, the parameters of the function
 * IasSrcFarrowFirFilter::init() have to be set appropriately.
